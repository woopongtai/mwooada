# outline:
# create hashs with applicable information for each party: tickets, cash on food, total cash spent
# create 3 cycle loop (one for each party).
# Loop should contain user inputs for tickets, orders of cotton candy, orders of curly fries (large, small). 
# ticket intake needs to take into account discount for 4 tickets (remainder tool?).
# post loop: create two arrays and one hash
# array 1: total cash earned by fair
# array 2: total amount spent on concessions
# hash: party number and amount spent
